    -do nothing
    ```    
* Pull changes and merge master to yout branch
    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout branch_name
    git merge master
   ```
* Making new feature or bugfix branch branch_name 
    ```
    git checkout -b feature-unique_id-functionality
    git checkout -b bugfix-unique_id-functionality
   ```
* Commit

    git add *
    git commit -m 'Description of changes'
